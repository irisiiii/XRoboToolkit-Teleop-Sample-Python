# XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python

Pico teleoperation demo written in python for both mujoco simulation and robot hardware.

## Overview

This project provides a framework for controlling robots in robot hardware and MuJoCo simulation through XR (VR/AR) input devices. It allows users to manipulate robot arms using natural hand movements captured through XR controllers.

## Installation
1. Download and install [XRoboToolkit PC Service](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service). Run the installed program before running the following demo.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python.git
    cd XRoboToolkit-Teleop-Sample-Python
    ```

3.  **Installation**
    **Note:** The setup scripts are currently only tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
    It is recommended to setup a Conda environment and install the project using the included script.
    ```bash
    bash setup_conda.sh --conda <optional_env_name>
    conda activate <env_name>
    bash setup_conda.sh --install
    ```

    If installing on system python:
    ```bash
    bash setup.sh
    ```

    <!-- **Note:** The `setup_conda.sh` script is currently only supported on Ubuntu. For Windows users, please follow these steps:
    1. Manually build the [`xrobotookit_sdk`](https://github.com/XR-Robotics/XRoboToolkit-PC-Service-Pybind).
    2. Then, install this package using `pip install -e .` in your activated Conda environment or system Python. -->

## Usage
Use the following instructions to run example scripts. For a more detailed description, please refer to [`teleop_details.md`](teleop_details.md).

### Running the MuJoCo Simulation Demo

To run the teleoperation demo with a UR5e robot in MuJoCo simulation:

```bash
python scripts/simulation/teleop_dual_ur5e_mujoco.py
```
This script initializes the [`MujocoTeleopController`](xrobotoolkit_teleop/simulation/mujoco_teleop_controller.py) with the UR5e model and starts the teleoperation loop.

### Running the Placo Visualization Demo

To run the teleoperation demo with a UR5e robot in Placo visualization:

```bash
python scripts/simulation/teleop_x7s_placo.py
```
This script initializes the [`PlacoTeleopController`](xrobotoolkit_teleop/simulation/placo_teleop_controller.py) with the X7S robot and starts the teleoperation loop.

### Running the Hardware Demo (Dual UR5 Arms and Dynamixel-based Head)

To run the teleoperation demo with the physical dual UR arms and Dynamixel-based head:

1.  **Normal Operation:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/hardware/teleop_dual_ur5e_hardware.py
    ```
    This script initializes the [`DynamixelHeadController`](xrobotoolkit_teleop/hardware/dynamixel.py) and [`DualArmURController`](xrobotoolkit_teleop/hardware/ur.py) and starts the teleoperation loops for both head tracking and arm control.

2.  **Resetting Arm Positions:**
    If you need to reset the UR arms to their initial/home positions and initialize the robotiq grippers, you can run the script with the `--reset` flag:
    ```bash
    python scripts/hardware/teleop_dual_ur5e_hardware.py --reset
    ```
    This will execute the reset procedure defined in the [`DualArmURController`](xrobotoolkit_teleop/hardware/ur.py) and then exit.

3.  **Visualizing IK results:**
    To visualize the inverse kinematics solution with placo during teleoperation, run the script with the `--visualize_placo` flag.
    ```bash
    python scripts/hardware/teleop_dual_ur5e_hardware.py --visualize_placo
    ```

### Running Galaxea A1X arm
To run the teleoperation demo with a Galaxea A1X arm, follow the [instruction](https://docs.galaxea-ai.com/zh/Guide/A1XY/A1XY_Startup_Demo_Guide/) to setup the ROS environment. In two command line windows, run the following scripts.
```bash
roslaunch HDAS A1XY.launch
```
```bash
python scripts/hardware/teleop_a1x_hardware.py
```
